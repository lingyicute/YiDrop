**Compatibility**

| Platform | Minimum Version |
|----------|-----------------|
| Android  | 5.0             |
| Windows  | 10              |

## Setup

In most cases, YiDrop should work out of the box. However, if you are having trouble sending or receiving files, you may need to configure your firewall to allow YiDrop to communicate over your local network.

| Traffic Type | Protocol | Port  | Action |
|--------------|----------|-------|--------|
| Incoming     | TCP, UDP | 59420 | Allow  |
| Outgoing     | TCP, UDP | Any   | Allow  |

Also make sure to disable AP isolation on your router. It should be usually disabled by default but some routers may have it enabled (especially guest networks).

**Portable Mode**

Create a file named `settings.json` located in the same directory as the executable.
This file can be empty.
The app will use this file to store settings instead of the default location.

**Start hidden**

To start the app hidden (only in tray), use the `--hidden` flag.

## How It Works

YiDrop uses a secure communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other using a REST API. All data is sent securely over HTTPS, and the TLS/SSL certificate is generated on the fly on each device, ensuring maximum security.

| Device not visible | Any                | Any                  | Make sure to disable AP-Isolation on your router. If it is enabled, connections between devices are forbidden.                          |
| Device not visible | Any                | Windows              | Make sure to configure your network as a "private" network. Windows might be more restrictive when the network is configured as public. |
